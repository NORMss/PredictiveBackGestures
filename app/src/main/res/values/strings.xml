    <string name="long_text">"Predictive Back, a gesture navigation feature, lets users preview where the back swipe takes them.
For example, using a back gesture can display an animated preview of the Home screen behind your app, as presented in the mockup in figure 1.
Starting with Android 15, the developer option for predictive back animations is no longer available. System animations such as back-to-home, cross-task, and cross-activity now appear for apps that have opted in to the predictive back gesture either entirely or at an activity level.</string>
